# ai-implementations
Implementations and descriptions of several ai algorithms written using PyTorch.  For each algorithm there is a complete working implementation, as well as a jupyter notebook that explains the algorithm in more depth.  More algorithms will be added overtime.

Implemented algorithms:
- coming soon


## Usage

The jupyter notebooks can be viewed in github.  To run the algorithms, the following steps will get you setup.

1. Create a python 3.6 virtual environment.  I used Anaconda for this.
```
conda create -n yourenvname python=3.6
```

2. After activating the environment, pip install the requirements file.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
